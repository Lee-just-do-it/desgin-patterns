Hi Humans

When nothing seems to help,I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two,and I know it was not that blow that did it——but all that had gone before. ——Jacob Riis
